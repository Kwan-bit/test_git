            Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.
            Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone—hobbyists, students, and professionals—and it’s full-color throughout
            Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging
            Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from beginning to end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure
            This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back to. It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple, attractive and engaging way! </p>

            <p>About This Book
            This book gets you started with the exciting world of C++ programming
            It will enable you to write C++ code that uses the standard library, has a level of object orientation, and uses memory in a safe and effective way
            It forms the basis of programming and covers concepts such as data structures and the core programming language
            Who This Book Is For
            A computer, an internet connection, and the desire to learn how to code in C++ is all you need to get started with this book.

            What You Will Learn
            Get familiar with the structure of C++ projects
            Identify the main structures in the language: functions and classes
            Feel confident about being able to identify the execution flow through the code
            Be aware of the facilities of the standard library
            Gain insights into the basic concepts of object orientation
            Know how to debug your programs
            Get acquainted with the standard C++ library
            In Detail
            C++ has come a long way and is now adopted in several contexts. Its key strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers, and performance-critical applications, not to forget its importance in game programming. Despite its strengths in these areas, beginners usually tend to shy away from learning the language because of its steep learning curve.

            The main mission of this book is to make you familiar and comfortable with C++. You will finish the book not only being able to write your own code, but more importantly, you will be able to read other projects. It is only by being able to read others' code that you will progress from a beginner to an advanced programmer. This book is the first step in that progression.

            The first task is to familiarize you with the structure of C++ projects so you will know how to start reading a project. Next, you will be able to identify the main structures in the language, functions, and classes, and feel confident being able to identify the execution flow through the code. You will then become aware of the facilities of the standard library and be able to determine whether you need to write a routine yourself, or use an existing routine in the standard library.

            Throughout the book, there is a big emphasis on memory and pointers. You will understand memory usage, allocation, and access, and be able to write code that does not leak memory. Finally, you will learn about C++ classes and get an introduction to object orientation and polymorphism.

            Style and approach
            This straightforward tutorial will help you build strong skills in C++ programming, be it for enterprise software or for low-latency applications such as games or embedded programming. Filled with examples, this book will take you gradually up the steep learning curve of C++.</p>

            <p><em>An Introductory Guide for CCNA & Computer Networking Beginners</p></em>
            A guide that will cover everything in Cisco Routing and Switching Command, including Subnetting, vlsm and Supernetting. You will be able pass your CCNA (Cisco Certified Networking Associate) exam and become a Cisco technology specialist sooner than you expected.

            The book is structured on 4 modules, which are exactly the ones you need for CCNA. Every command you have to know is presented and explained here. After you'll read this book, you'll be able to:

            How to manage and configure Cisco devices (Routers, Switches)
            How to troubleshoot with key commands
            How can you apply this knowledge in a practical scenario
            Written for simplicity so that you can learn Cisco IOS quickly and effectively.
            You'll learn computer networking while executing commands.
            The book includes configuration scenarios such as:
            Basic configurations on Routers and Switches
            Routing Protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, eBGP, RIP)
            Switching (VLANs, STPs, VTPs)
            Redundancy (HSRP, EtherChannel)
            Security (ACL, Security Switching, VPN), etc.
            Becoming a professional networking engineer is now easier than ever. If you buy this book NOW, you'll shortly see that Cisco Routing and Command are something anyone can understand with a little bit of practice.</p>
